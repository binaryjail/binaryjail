Dual License

Dockerbox is available under a dual license. Use of Dockerbox in projects that are licensed in a way compatible with AGPL Version 3 may use Dockerbox under the terms of that license. However, if AGPL Version 3.0 terms are incompatible with your planned use of Dockerbox, alternative license terms are available â€” please direct inquiries about Dockerbox licensing to andrey@jisto.com.
